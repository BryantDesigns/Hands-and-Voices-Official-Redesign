						ASTra is an educational advocacy program that embodies the mission and vision of Hands & Voices. ASTra stands for the Advocacy Support and
						Training Program. We provide support to families with children who are deaf or hard of hearing (d/hh) without bias around communication
						mode, method, or educational setting so that every child has the opportunity to achieve their full potential. We foster collaboration and
						build partnerships with school districts and other professionals who serve deaf or hard of hearing students.
