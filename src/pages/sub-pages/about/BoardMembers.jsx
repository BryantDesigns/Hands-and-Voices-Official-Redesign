				<h1>Alabama Hands & Voices Board of Directors</h1>
				<p>
					The Alabama Hands & Voices Board of Directors oversees the programs, staff, and fundraising efforts of our nonprofit in support of families
					raising children who are deaf or hard of hearing. The Board is comprised parents, professionals and Deaf/hard of hearing adults who
					represent a diverse community. The President of every Hands & Voices Chapter Board must be a parent of a child who is deaf or hard of
					hearing. We are always looking to develop parent leaders, whether serving on the board, as Parent Guides, or on committees locally and
					statewide. For more information about board positions, please contact the Executive Director at alabamahinfo@gmail.com

					<h1>KRISTINE LEMOYNE MATHIS HENDERSON</h1>
					<h1>In Memoriam</h1>
					<p>
						Kristine Lemoyne Mathis Henderson was instrumental in founding Alabama Hands & Voices. She attended one of our earliest get togethers
						became a member of the Board of Directors in 2018. As the child of deaf parents (CODA - Child of Deaf Adult), a nurse, and the mother of a
						deaf son she brought so much wisdom to the formation of Alabama Hands & Voices. Her calm and warm personality drew people to her. She
						served on the board while fighting cancer. She passed away far too young in March 2020. We miss her very much and dedicate ourselves to
						serving families of deaf and hard of hearing children in her honor.
