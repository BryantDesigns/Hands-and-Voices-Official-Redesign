						<h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>
						<p>
							We are parents of kids who are deaf or hard of hearing (to whatever degree). We are parents of ASL and other visual language signers,
							kids who use listening and spoken language, cued speech users, total communicators, kids with hearing aids and/or cochlear implants, and
							kids who do not use technology to hear. We are people who have common interests connected through the community of deafness. Hands &
							Voices is a safe place to explore options, get unemotional support, learn from one another and share what we have in common. We value
							diversity and honor the role of parents and family as the single greatest factor in raising a well-adjusted, successful kid.

						There is room in the community of deafness for an organization like Hands & Voices, and in fact, I think parents, and many professionals,
						have been crying out for a group like this” says Leeanne Seaver, of Hands & Voices. "Somehow parents connecting to other parents provides
						an element of credibility; there's a level of 'knowing & feeling' that only a parent experiences. And parents, especially parents of
						babies newly identified with deafness or hearing loss, need a way to connect like this without being wary of a sponsoring agenda from a
						service provider." Hands & Voices is a non-profit, parent-driven national organization dedicated to supporting families of children who
						are deaf or hard of hearing. We are non-biased about communication methodologies and believe that families can make the best choices for
						their child if they have access to good information and support. Our membership includes families who communicate manually and/or orally.
						From American Sign Language to cochlear implants and spoken language, our organization represents people from all different approaches to,
						and experiences with, deafness or hearing loss. We are one of over 40 Hands & Voices chapters comprised mainly of parents along with
						professionals.

				<h1>WHY WE ARE HERE</h1>
				<p>
					Many organizations for the deaf or hard of hearing rally around a philosophy of communication. Hands & Voices does not promote specific
					communication choices or methodologies, but we have information about them and can direct families or professionals to support organizations
					for specific information. Our rallying points are areas of interest that are common to all people, but especially parents, connected by the
					interests of the deaf or hard of hearing, and include these values ….
