				<h1>Alabama Hands & Voices Guide By Your Side</h1>
				<p>
					At Alabama Hands & Voices, we understand the power of parents sharing and connecting. The Alabama Hands & Voices Guide By Your Side program
					is dedicated to directly supporting families and their children who have been diagnosed with a hearing loss, by offering families the
					opportunity to talk or meet, face-to-face, with a trained Parent Guide.

				<h1>WHAT THE GBYS PROGRAM CAN DO FOR YOU</h1>
				<p>
					Parent Guides are parents of children who are deaf or hard of hearing who have been trained to provide support and advocacy to families. Our
					guides are able to bring their own experiences in raising a deaf/hh child and are knowledgeable about this journey. To summarize, we have
					been where you currently are.
